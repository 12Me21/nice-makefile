A makefile (for C projects) that I've used a few times.<br>
I use _gnu make_ and <u>gcc</u>, on <u>linux</u><br>
this system should work with other platforms but I haven't tested it and it may need some changes.<br>

<he>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>automatically determines which c files depend on which headers
<li>requires almost no manual configuration, just give it a list of source files (and compiler flags etc.)
<li>all temporary (`.o` etc.) files are placed in a subdirectory
<li>clean output:<br>

</ul>
<h2>Bugs</h2>
- no `make clean` (however, keep in mind you can use `make -B` to force remaking everything, and/or delete the files in the junk directory)
